**ChoiRbot** is a ROS 2 toolbox developed within the excellence research program ERC in the project [OPT4SMART](http://opt4smart.dei.unibo.it).
**ChoiRbot** provides a comprehensive set of libraries to execute complex distributed multi-robot tasks, such as model predictive control and task assignment, either in simulation or experimentally. The toolbox focuses on networks of heterogeneous robots without a central coordinator. It provides utilities for the solution of distributed optimization problems and can be also used to implement distributed feedback laws. Specifically, the package allows you to

- Encode distributed optimization and control algorithms
- Perform peer-to-peer communications among robots
- Develop planning and control schemes
- Connect with external motion capture hardware (see also our [ROS 2 Vicon Bridge](https://github.com/OPT4SMART/ros2-vicon-receiver))
- Run experiments on your robotic fleet
- Perform realistic simulations with [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org) and visualize data with [RVIZ](https://github.com/ros2/rviz)

## Requirements and Installation
**ChoiRbot** requires ROS 2 Dashing Diademata to be installed on your system.

It relies on

* numpy
* scipy
* recordclass
* dill
* disropt (optional, but required for several features)

Please, refer to the [installation page](https://opt4smart.github.io/ChoiRbot/installation) for a more detailed installation guide.

To install the toolbox, first source your ROS 2 installation. Then create a ROS 2 workspace and, inside the `src` directory, run:
```
git clone https://github.com/OPT4SMART/ChoiRbot.git .
```

Then, from the parent directory execute:
```
colcon build --symlink-install
```
