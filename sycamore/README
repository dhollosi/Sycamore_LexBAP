In this package lie the main additional contributions to the existing ChoiRbot package. 

For both assignments types (LexBAP and LSAP), the matchings are sorted in ascending order and saved in .pk files in order to generate a correct agent ID for the ROS2 launch files.
Please note that currently, the agent-task matchings are "foced" by using previously saved files in the "task_sycamore" modules

Instructions :

1) Run ap_generator.py (set use_data to False). This generate .pk files
2) in parent directory, source the ROS2 directory, and run the command colcon build
3) run the command source install/setup.bash
4) run the desired launch file : ros2 launch sycamore lexBAP.launch.py/linSAP.launch.py

There should be an example provided. 

Please note that the latest commit of ChoiRbot includes quadrotors, which require additional terms for the pose. This was overidden in order to work with the current implementation of the afore-mentioned code.

Please do not hesitate to contact me for any further information!
