In this package lie the main additional contributions to the existing ChoiRbot package. 

For both assignments types (LexBAP and LSAP), the matchings are sorted in ascending order and saved in .pk files in order to generate a correct agent ID for the ROS2 launch files.
Please note that currently, the agent-task matchings are "foced" by using previously saved files in the "task_sycamore" modules
